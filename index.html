                     <p>For most of my life I never knew what to do, always having time to spend in which I did nothing for the most part. <br>
                        During this free time, I would play random games that I found online, and mainly read alot, due to the lack of<br> of
                        a social life. But, from all of that, one thing began to become more and more interesting to me over time, the world<br>
                        of technology. Over my childhood, I became more and more interested in it, how it worked, how to make things, and<br>
                        also, how to program. This however, was always a problem to start, as I could never focus and sit down and <br>

                <p>My programming skills vary, but I am good in many languages, some of those
                    <br> being Java, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, C#. My Expertise with Java is <br>
                    the best out of all my languages, with it being the first language I ever for doing<br>
                    with in depth use, and wasn't scratch, which is a block oriented language used to teach<br>
                    programming to young children mainly.</p>
