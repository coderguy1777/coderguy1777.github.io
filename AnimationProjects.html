                        within the UV Texturing software known as substance painter, and using materials created
                        from Algorithmic substance designer. The story behind the skit is quite simple due to
                        the purpose of it, that mainly being to demonstrate simple skills. But mainly, the story
                        is about a Robot, who happens to wake up, at the end of a great war between an unknown alien
                        race, and only lives long enough just to see the end of the war, before running out of power
                        and dieing, watching the sunset, and the war coming to an end.</p>

                        earth planetary colony. A great war rages on between two alien races, the ytari,
                        and the hnadi's, over one key planet, XOS-14. XOS-14 is such a main focus of this war, due to one main factor:
                        the guardian prime. The guardian prime is an ancient resource, known as the utheyia, which has the power to
                        control all of time and existence. The two sides have been over a stalemate in combat for over 100 years, and,
                        now it's time to decide the victor, at Planet XOS-14.</p>
